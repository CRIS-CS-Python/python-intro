## Loops and Iteration

Iteration means repeating a set of instructions (or block of code) repeatedly
until a condition is met.

### `while` Loop

```python
while <boolean value is True>:
    <body>
```

Execute the block of code in *body* as long as the *boolean condition* is true.

### `for` Loop

```python
for variable in iterable:
    <body>
```

Given an *iterable* value, assign each item in the iterable to *variable*
(one at a time), and execute the block of code in *body*.
